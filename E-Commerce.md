# 4. Brief history of E commerce

E-commerce originated in a standard for the exchange of business documents, such as orders or invoices, between suppliers and their business customers. Those origins date to the 1948–49 Berlin blockade and airlift with a system of ordering goods primarily via telex. Various industries elaborated upon that system in the ensuing decades before the first general standard was published in 1975. The resulting computer-to-computer electronic data interchange (EDI) standard is flexible enough to handle most simple electronic business transactions.


With the wide adoption of the Internet and the introduction of the World Wide Web in 1991 and of the first browser for accessing it in 1993, most e-commerce shifted to the Internet. More recently, with the global spread of smartphones and the accessibility of fast broadband connections to the Internet, much e-commerce moved to mobile devices, which also included tablets, laptops, and wearable products such as watches.


E-commerce has deeply affected everyday life and how business and governments operate. Commerce is conducted in electronic marketplaces (or marketspaces) and in the supply chains working on the Internet-Web. Consumer-oriented marketplaces include large e-malls (such as Amazon), consumer-to-consumer auction platforms (eBay, for example), multichannel retailers (such as L.L. Bean), and many millions of e-retailers. Massive business-to-business marketplaces have been created by Alibaba and other companies. The so-called sharing economy enables more efficient use of resources, as Airbnb does with online rentals of private residences. Almost instantaneous access to services is made available by on-demand platforms offering, for example, transportation (e.g., Uber), computation and storage resources furnished by cloud service providers, and medical and legal advice. Mass customization of goods sold online, such as garments and vehicles, became common. Electronic currencies (or cryptocurrencies) such as Bitcoin entered into play as the means of settlement. Semipermanent supply chains enable a hub company (such as Dell) to surround itself with suppliers that perform most production tasks and deliver other goods and services to the central firm.


Social network sites, such as Facebook, undergird a great variety of individual relationships and are the site of so-called social commerce, driven by the opinions and reviews shared by the participants as the electronic word-of-mouth. Online communities bind together participants who wish to share their knowledge, forge lasting relationships, or present themselves on a broad forum. Those communities became a potent source of cocreation of value by individuals who together and over long stretches of time, for example, produce open-source software or continually replenish an online encyclopaedia.



The Web is also an interactive medium of human communication that supplements, and often replaces, traditional media. The hypermedia nature of the Web, with the interlinking of multimedia content available on globally distributed sites, enables creation of new types of media products, often offered free of charge. Those new media include blogs, video aggregators (such as YouTube), social media (built with wiki technology, for example), and customized electronic newspapers. As with all media, this aspect of the Web leads to its use in marketing. Web advertising ranges from the display ads on Web sites to keyword ads shown to information seekers using search engines, such as Google. Mobile advertising is expanding apace because of the extensive use of smartphones. Deep knowledge of individuals is available to marketers because of the electronic collection of multifaceted profiles as people navigate the Web. In particular, location-based promotion of goods and services may be enabled in mobile commerce. The ability to derive revenue from ads drives various business models (for example, search engines) and produces incremental revenue for other businesses, as their customers access their Web sites or use mobile apps and can be exposed to the advertising messages.



# 5. [Inter organizational e commerce](https://www.solutionweb.in/inter-organizational-transaction/)
Inter-organizational e-commerce refers to the full spectrum of e-commerce that can occur between two organizations. It is the e-commerce between businesses i.e. the businesses focus on selling to other businesses in the B2B e-commerce. ...

# 7. Consumer to business E commerce

## What is consumer to business?
Consumer to business, or C2B, is the least traditional of all six e-commerce models. With C2B, the seller is an individual consumer and the buyer is a business or company, similar to a sole proprietorship serving a large company. Consumers offer products or services to businesses in exchange for payment or other benefits. Consumer to business differs from the other models because it's the consumers who create product value and business value. It is the complete opposite of the traditional business to consumer e-commerce model, where businesses sell products or services to consumers.

The C2B model caters to independent workers and freelancers who accomplish paid tasks provided by the business or company. Independent workers are people who offer their services or products on a website specifically created for the purpose of C2B e-commerce. They interact with the businesses and negotiate their own deals on their own terms. Freelancers are people who sell products or provide services, mostly on C2B e-commerce websites specifically designed for freelancers. They make up the majority of C2B workers.

Businesses go to C2B online platforms to look for skilled service providers or unique product sellers, then hire the independent workers or freelances who meet their needs. The platform is sometimes a third party that charges a commission or fee for connecting the sellers with the businesses. There are more legal complexities with the C2B model than other e-commerce models, so it requires a lot of planning to accomplish successfully.

## Examples of consumer to business
Here are some example scenarios of C2B:

* A chef blogger who bills a kitchen company for promoting their cooking products on the blog.
* A tech blogger who displays a company's service ads to their audience in exchange for profits.
* Service providers who work online like content creators, social media managers, programmers or brand managers.
* Photographers who sell their images on e-commerce websites designed for selling images.
* Social media users who fill in survey or promote products and services.
* Large stores with an online only presence who hire consumers to promote their products and services.

## Benefits of consumer to business
There are many benefits to the C2B e-commerce model, including:

* Flexibility in the C2B revenue model since business and sellers can define their own revenue parameters like the duration of services, how often payment gets collected or product supply dates.
* Sellers have unlimited earning potential since they can work as much as they want, with whichever business they choose and provide their services and product to as many businesses as they want.
* Businesses have the opportunity to prioritize how they hire sellers, giving them the ability to hire from specific regions like where the income or standard of living is lower, reducing their costs.
* Sellers have the opportunity to gain valuable work experience with multiple businesses across multiple projects, and the sellers can get paid well for their services.
* More freedom and flexibility for freelancers to enjoy in terms of the number of hours they choose to work, and less geographical limitations for providing their services.
* Consumers can provide their products or services to a business without having to create a business or go into business for themselves.

# 2. Digital token based electronic payment system

The digital token based payment system is a new form of electronic payment system which is based on electronic tokens rather than e-cheque or e-cash.

3. Credit or Postpaid;-
These types of electronic token based on the identity of customers which issue a card, their authentication and verification by a third party. In this system the server authenticate the customers and then verify their identity through the bank. After all these processing the transaction take place. Example is E-Cheques.


The Digital Token based system have following issues for which they are established:-

1. Nature of transaction for which instrument is designed:-
In this category, the design issues of token take place. It may be designed to handle micro payments. It may be designed for conventional products. Some tokens are designed specifically and other generally. The design issue involve involvement of parties, purchase interaction and average amount.

3. Approach to Security, Anonymity and Authentication:-
Since the electronic token are vary from system to system when the business transaction take place. So it is necessary to secure it by intruders and hackers. For this purpose various security features are provided with electronic tokens such as the method of encryption. The encryption method use the digital signatures of the customers for verification and authentication.

4. Risk Factors:-
The electronic tokens may be worthless and if the customer have currency on token than nobody will accept it, If the transaction has long time between delivery of products and payments to merchants then merchant exposes to the risk. so it is important to analysis risk factor in electronic payment system.
