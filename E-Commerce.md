# 4. Brief history of E commerce

E-commerce originated in a standard for the exchange of business documents, such as orders or invoices, between suppliers and their business customers. Those origins date to the 1948–49 Berlin blockade and airlift with a system of ordering goods primarily via telex. Various industries elaborated upon that system in the ensuing decades before the first general standard was published in 1975. The resulting computer-to-computer electronic data interchange (EDI) standard is flexible enough to handle most simple electronic business transactions.


With the wide adoption of the Internet and the introduction of the World Wide Web in 1991 and of the first browser for accessing it in 1993, most e-commerce shifted to the Internet. More recently, with the global spread of smartphones and the accessibility of fast broadband connections to the Internet, much e-commerce moved to mobile devices, which also included tablets, laptops, and wearable products such as watches.


E-commerce has deeply affected everyday life and how business and governments operate. Commerce is conducted in electronic marketplaces (or marketspaces) and in the supply chains working on the Internet-Web. Consumer-oriented marketplaces include large e-malls (such as Amazon), consumer-to-consumer auction platforms (eBay, for example), multichannel retailers (such as L.L. Bean), and many millions of e-retailers. Massive business-to-business marketplaces have been created by Alibaba and other companies. The so-called sharing economy enables more efficient use of resources, as Airbnb does with online rentals of private residences. Almost instantaneous access to services is made available by on-demand platforms offering, for example, transportation (e.g., Uber), computation and storage resources furnished by cloud service providers, and medical and legal advice. Mass customization of goods sold online, such as garments and vehicles, became common. Electronic currencies (or cryptocurrencies) such as Bitcoin entered into play as the means of settlement. Semipermanent supply chains enable a hub company (such as Dell) to surround itself with suppliers that perform most production tasks and deliver other goods and services to the central firm.


Social network sites, such as Facebook, undergird a great variety of individual relationships and are the site of so-called social commerce, driven by the opinions and reviews shared by the participants as the electronic word-of-mouth. Online communities bind together participants who wish to share their knowledge, forge lasting relationships, or present themselves on a broad forum. Those communities became a potent source of cocreation of value by individuals who together and over long stretches of time, for example, produce open-source software or continually replenish an online encyclopaedia.



The Web is also an interactive medium of human communication that supplements, and often replaces, traditional media. The hypermedia nature of the Web, with the interlinking of multimedia content available on globally distributed sites, enables creation of new types of media products, often offered free of charge. Those new media include blogs, video aggregators (such as YouTube), social media (built with wiki technology, for example), and customized electronic newspapers. As with all media, this aspect of the Web leads to its use in marketing. Web advertising ranges from the display ads on Web sites to keyword ads shown to information seekers using search engines, such as Google. Mobile advertising is expanding apace because of the extensive use of smartphones. Deep knowledge of individuals is available to marketers because of the electronic collection of multifaceted profiles as people navigate the Web. In particular, location-based promotion of goods and services may be enabled in mobile commerce. The ability to derive revenue from ads drives various business models (for example, search engines) and produces incremental revenue for other businesses, as their customers access their Web sites or use mobile apps and can be exposed to the advertising messages.



# 5. [Inter organizational e commerce](https://www.solutionweb.in/inter-organizational-transaction/)
Inter-organizational e-commerce refers to the full spectrum of e-commerce that can occur between two organizations. It is the e-commerce between businesses i.e. the businesses focus on selling to other businesses in the B2B e-commerce. ... Companies are now mutually buying and selling products and services on the internet.

It includes companies doing business with one-another with a goal to save money on purchases that can be negotiated easily. Companies are now mutually buying and selling products and services on the internet.

Inter-organizational e-commerce many reduce the transaction costs, increase the availability of products and suppliers and reduce dependencies on a few trading partners and products.

Moreover, they offer many secondary services towards integrating purchasing, distribution, and inventory processes, streamlining the entire transaction process. Thus, it allows better inventory management, quality control and supply chain processes.

Business organizations are constantly buying and selling goods and services. Shops buy products in bulk from their suppliers and sell those goods in small quantities to their customers.

Manufactures buy raw material or components from their suppliers, assemble them into new products and sell them to their customers. 

Retailers make a great number of transactions and the whole operation of their business is dependent on their effective execution.

Other business service sector organizations such as accountants may be less dependent on a constant flow of goods but they still need supplies and they are careful to account for the transactions with their transactions.

For all businesses, there is a web of inter-organizational transactions. This web of transactions forms a value chain and is illustrated as the Logistics Network in the following figure:

# 7. Consumer to business E commerce

## What is consumer to business?
Consumer to business, or C2B, is the least traditional of all six e-commerce models. With C2B, the seller is an individual consumer and the buyer is a business or company, similar to a sole proprietorship serving a large company. Consumers offer products or services to businesses in exchange for payment or other benefits. Consumer to business differs from the other models because it's the consumers who create product value and business value. It is the complete opposite of the traditional business to consumer e-commerce model, where businesses sell products or services to consumers.

The C2B model caters to independent workers and freelancers who accomplish paid tasks provided by the business or company. Independent workers are people who offer their services or products on a website specifically created for the purpose of C2B e-commerce. They interact with the businesses and negotiate their own deals on their own terms. Freelancers are people who sell products or provide services, mostly on C2B e-commerce websites specifically designed for freelancers. They make up the majority of C2B workers.

Businesses go to C2B online platforms to look for skilled service providers or unique product sellers, then hire the independent workers or freelances who meet their needs. The platform is sometimes a third party that charges a commission or fee for connecting the sellers with the businesses. There are more legal complexities with the C2B model than other e-commerce models, so it requires a lot of planning to accomplish successfully.

## Examples of consumer to business
Here are some example scenarios of C2B:

* A chef blogger who bills a kitchen company for promoting their cooking products on the blog.
* A tech blogger who displays a company's service ads to their audience in exchange for profits.
* Service providers who work online like content creators, social media managers, programmers or brand managers.
* Photographers who sell their images on e-commerce websites designed for selling images.
* Social media users who fill in survey or promote products and services.
* Large stores with an online only presence who hire consumers to promote their products and services.

## Benefits of consumer to business
There are many benefits to the C2B e-commerce model, including:

* Flexibility in the C2B revenue model since business and sellers can define their own revenue parameters like the duration of services, how often payment gets collected or product supply dates.
* Sellers have unlimited earning potential since they can work as much as they want, with whichever business they choose and provide their services and product to as many businesses as they want.
* Businesses have the opportunity to prioritize how they hire sellers, giving them the ability to hire from specific regions like where the income or standard of living is lower, reducing their costs.
* Sellers have the opportunity to gain valuable work experience with multiple businesses across multiple projects, and the sellers can get paid well for their services.
* More freedom and flexibility for freelancers to enjoy in terms of the number of hours they choose to work, and less geographical limitations for providing their services.
* Consumers can provide their products or services to a business without having to create a business or go into business for themselves.

## TCP/Ip
* TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).
* TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol which is defined as the language of the Internet. An example of TCP/IP in action is a person accessing a website.
* (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) The most widely used communications protocol. TCP/IP prepares and forwards data packets over a network such as Ethernet.


## SSL
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) provides security to the data that is transferred between web browser and server. SSL encrypts the link between a web server and a browser which ensures that all data passed between them remain private and free from attack. 

Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is that the normal security technology for establishing associate encrypted link between an internet server and a browser. This link ensures that each one knowledge passed between the online server and browsers stay personal and integral.

SSL is associate trade normal and is employed by numerous websites within the protection of their on-line transactions with their customers. SSL permits counselling like Social Security numbers, mastercard numbers, or login credentials to be transmitted firmly..

### Secure Socket Layer Protocols: 
* SSL record protocol

# 2. Digital token based electronic payment system

The digital token based payment system is a new form of electronic payment system which is based on electronic tokens rather than e-cheque or e-cash. The electronic tokens are generated by the bank or some financial institutions. Hence we can say that the electronic tokens are equivalent to the cash which are to be made by the bank.

Categories of Electronic Tokens:-

I. Cash or Real Time:-
In this mode of electronic tokens transactions takes place via the exchange of electronic currency (e-cash).

2. Debit or Prepaid:-
In this electronic payment system the prepaid facilities are provided. It means that for transactions of information user pay in advance. This technology are used in smart card, electronic purses etc.

3. Credit or Postpaid;-
These types of electronic token based on the identity of customers which issue a card, their authentication and verification by a third party. In this system the server authenticate the customers and then verify their identity through the bank. After all these processing the transaction take place. Example is E-Cheques.


The Digital Token based system have following issues for which they are established:-

1. Nature of transaction for which instrument is designed:-
In this category, the design issues of token take place. It may be designed to handle micro payments. It may be designed for conventional products. Some tokens are designed specifically and other generally. The design issue involve involvement of parties, purchase interaction and average amount.

2. Means of Settlement:- The Digital Tokens are used when their format must be in cash, credit, electronic bill payments etc. Most transaction settlement methods use credit cards while other used proxies for values.

3. Approach to Security, Anonymity and Authentication:-
Since the electronic token are vary from system to system when the business transaction take place. So it is necessary to secure it by intruders and hackers. For this purpose various security features are provided with electronic tokens such as the method of encryption. The encryption method use the digital signatures of the customers for verification and authentication.

4. Risk Factors:-
The electronic tokens may be worthless and if the customer have currency on token than nobody will accept it, If the transaction has long time between delivery of products and payments to merchants then merchant exposes to the risk. so it is important to analysis risk factor in electronic payment system.

# 3. Smart card


Smart card is similar to a credit card or a debit card in appearance, but it has a small microprocessor chip embedded in it. It has the capacity to store a customer’s work-related and/or personal information. Smart cards are also used to store money and the amount gets deducted after every transaction.

Smart cards can only be accessed using a PIN that every customer is assigned with. Smart cards are secure, as they store information in encrypted format and are less expensive/provides faster processing. Mondex and Visa Cash cards are examples of smart cards.


![3179095](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42698268/145429441-cfd5e5e6-8946-4ae5-be24-747e0599b1d0.jpg)


A smart card, chip card, or integrated circuit card (ICC) is any pocket-sized card with embedded integrated circuits. Smart cards are made of plastic, generally polyvinyl chloride, but sometimes polyethylene terephthalate based polyesters, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or polycarbonate.


Smart cards can provide identification, authentication, data storage and application processing. Smart cards may provide strong security authentication for single sign-on (SSO) within large organizations

## Types of smart cards:


![7076046_orig](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42698268/145429657-28ab6f33-6300-4be6-bac9-84e6b736637e.jpg)

***1. Contact smart cards***

Contact smart cards have a contact area of approximately 1 square centimeter (0.16 sq in), comprising several gold-plated contact pads. These pads provide electrical connectivity when inserted into a reader,[8] which is used as a communications medium between the smart card and a host (e.g., a computer, a point of sale terminal) or a mobile telephone. Cards do not contain batteries; power is supplied by the card reader


***2.Contactless smart cards***

A second card type is the contactless smart card, in which the card communicates with and is powered by the reader through RF induction technology. These cards require only proximity to an antenna to communicate. Like smart cards with contacts, contactless cards do not have an internal power source. Instead, they use an inductor 'to capture some of the incident radio-frequency interrogation signal, rectify it, and use it to power the card's electronics

Example of widely used contactless smart cards are London's Oyster card, Hong Kong's Octopus card, Tokyo's Suica and Pasmo cards  used for public transportation


# 4. Credit card

Payment using credit card is one of most common mode of electronic payment. Credit card is small plastic card with a unique number attached with an account. It has also a magnetic strip embedded in it which is used to read credit card via card readers. When a customer purchases a product via credit card, credit card issuer bank pays on behalf of the customer and customer has a certain time period after which he/she can pay the credit card bill. It is usually credit card monthly payment cycle. Following are the actors in the credit card system.

   * The card holder − Customer
   * The merchant − seller of product who can accept credit card payments.
   * The card issuer bank − card holder's bank
   * The acquirer bank − the merchant's bank
   * The card brand − for example , visa or Mastercard.

# 5. Electronic cheque

## What Is an Electronic Check?

An electronic check, or e-check, is a form of payment made via the Internet, or another data network, designed to perform the same function as a conventional paper check. Since the check is in an electronic format, it can be processed in fewer steps.

Additionally, it has more security features than standard paper checks including authentication, public key cryptography, digital signatures, and encryption, among others.


KEY TAKEAWAYS

* An electronic check is a form of payment made via the internet that is designed to perform the same function as a conventional paper check.
* One of the more frequently used versions of the electronic check is the direct deposit system offered by many employers.
* Generally, the costs associated with issuing an electronic check are notably lower than those associated with paper checks.
* An electronic check has more security features than standard paper checks.

## How an Electronic Check Works

An electronic check is part of the larger electronic banking field and part of a subset of transactions referred to as electronic fund transfers (EFTs). This includes not only electronic checks but also other computerized banking functions such as ATM withdrawals and deposits, debit card transactions and remote check depositing features. The transactions require the use of various computer and networking technologies to gain access to the relevant account data to perform the requested actions.

Electronic checks were developed in response to the transactions that arose in the world of electronic commerce. Electronic checks can be used to make a payment for any transaction that a paper check can cover, and are governed by the same laws that apply to paper checks. This was the first form of Internet-based payment used by the U.S. Treasury for making large online payments.


## The Benefits of Electronic Checks
* Generally, the costs associated with issuing an electronic check are notably lower than those associated with paper checks. Not only is there no requirement for a physical paper check, which costs money to produce, but also electronic checks do not require physical postage in cases of payments being made to entities outside the direct reach of the entity issuing the funds.

* It is estimated that while a traditional check may cost as much as $1 to issue, an electronic check costs closer to $0.10.

* Electronic checks also come with a lower risk of the associated funds being stolen, as there is no tangible item to intercept.
* Further, there are multiple levels of authentication to help ensure funds are routed properly.

## Special Considerations
One of the more frequently used versions of the electronic check is the direct deposit system offered by many employers. It is an electronic method of sending an employee’s wages directly into the employee’s bank account. Additionally, taxpayers who are owed a refund on federal tax returns can elect to receive a directly deposited electronic check from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) instead of having a physical paper check sent through the mail.


# 6. E cash

## What Is eCash?
* eCash was a digital-based system that facilitated the transfer of funds anonymously. A pioneer in cryptocurrency, its goal was to secure the privacy of individuals that use the Internet for micropayments. eCash was created by Dr. David Chaum under his company, DigiCash, in 1990. Though there was interest in the platform from large banks, eCash never took off and DigiCash filed for bankruptcy in 1998. DigiCash, along with its eCash patents, was eventually sold off. In 2018, Chaum launched a new startup focused on cryptography.
* In providing a simple definition of eCash, also known as electronic cash, it is a digital money product that provides a way to pay for products and services without resorting to paper or coin currency. Two models emerged for e-cash transactions:

The online form of eCash, which was introduced by the now defunct DigiCash, worked for all types of Internet transactions.
The offline form of e-cash involved a digitally encoded card that replaced paper money. Mondex developed and tested this model with different banks, but the company has now transitioned into the development and management of smart cards also used for financial transactions.


KEY TAKEAWAYS

* eCash was an electronic platform created to transfer funds anonymously. It was a pioneer in cryptocurrency.
* eCash was created by Dr. David Chaum and implemented via his company, DigiCash, in 1990.
* eCash worked on the premise of blind signatures where message content is invisible before signing, resulting in no user being able to link withdrawal and spend transactions.
* Despite the initial interest and bringing large banks on board to use the system, eCash never fully took off and DigiCash filed for bankruptcy in 1998.
* Chaum launched a new startup in 2018 focused on cryptography.


## Understanding eCash

The idea for eCash came from Dr. David Chaum in 1983. He was ahead of his time in thinking about privacy concerns in the age of the Internet. And not only did he advocate for privacy but he took it a few steps further in creating an anonymous based payment system for the digital age. This was even before the Internet was available for public use. In 1990, Chaum created the company, DigiCash, to realize his idea for eCash.


The core concept behind eCash was blind signatures. A blind signature is a type of digital signature in which the message's content is invisible prior to signing. In this manner, no user is able to create a link between withdrawal and spend transactions. The money used in the system was called "CyberBucks."


## eCash's Rise and Fall
DigiCash gained a lot of traction in the 1990s when Internet companies were taking off. The company signed deals with many banks that intended to use the platform. These banks included Deutsche Bank (DB), Credit Suisse (CS), and other banks across the globe. Microsoft was also interested in eCash for Windows 95 but the two companies couldn't agree to a deal.

The banks that decided to implement eCash started testing the platform but never sold it as a viable product to its customers. The only bank that actually used the platform was Mark Twain Bank in St. Louis, Missouri. The service was free to buyers, but sellers had to pay a transaction fee. Mark Twain Bank had signed up 300 businesses and 5,000 individual users but the platform never gained traction. According to Chaum, "As the Web grew, the average level of sophistication of users dropped. It was hard to explain the importance of privacy to them."

DigiCash eventually filed for bankruptcy in 1998. It was sold off to eCash Technologies along with its patents for eCash. The trademark for the name is now with Due Inc. Due was founded in 2015 and is ranked one of the top 10 e-wallets in the world


## eCash and Online Security Today
Despite the failure of DigiCash and with it eCash, online security is an ongoing issue in the digital realm to this day. Financial information, stored on a computer or electronic device, or the Internet more generally (e.g., the cloud) is vulnerable to hackers. Cryptocurrencies are extremely popular today and owe their foundations to eCash. The most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which was created in 2009 by an anonymous creator and had a better luck gaining traction quickly. Overall, many consider Dr. Chaum to be the father of digital currency.

In 2018, Chaum launched a new startup called Elixxir, whose purpose is to create a cryptography network focused on communication anonymity, that is controlled by users to protect their information, as opposed to the current setup, where companies have detailed access to consumer information and use it for targeting ads to generate revenue.



# 7. Risk and solution in electronic payment system

Electronic payments allow you to transfer cash from your own bank account to the bank account of the recipient almost instantaneously. This payment system relies heavily on the internet and is quite popular due to the convenience it affords the user. It would be hard to overstate the advantages of electronic payment systems, but what about the risks? Certainly they exist, both for financial institutions and consumers.

## a. The Risk of Fraud
Electronic payment systems are not immune to the risk of fraud. The system uses a particularly vulnerable protocol to establish the identity of the person authorizing a payment. Passwords and security questions aren’t foolproof in determining the identity of a person. So long as the password and the answers to the security questions are correct, the system doesn’t care who’s on the other side. If someone gains access to your password or the answers to your security question, they will have gained access to your money and can steal it from you.

## b. The Risk of Tax Evasion
The law requires that businesses declare their financial transactions and provide paper records of them so that tax compliance can be verified. The problem with electronic systems is that they don’t fit very cleanly into this paradigm and so they can make the process of tax collection very frustrating for the Internal Revenue Service. It is at the business’s discretion to disclose payments received or made via electronic payment systems in a fiscal period, and the IRS has no way of knowing if it’s telling the truth or not. That makes it pretty easy to evade taxation.

## c. The Risk of Payment Conflicts
One of the idiosyncrasies of electronic payment systems is that the payments aren’t handled by humans but by an automated electronic system. The system is prone to errors, particularly when it has to handle large amounts of payments on a frequent basis with many recipients involved. It’s important to constantly check your pay slip after every pay period ends in order to ensure everything makes sense. Failure to do this may result in payment conflicts caused by technical glitches and anomalies.

## d. The Risk of Impulse Buying
Impulse buying is already a risk that you face when you use non-electronic payment systems. It is magnified, however, when you’re able to buy things online at the click of a mouse. Impulse buying can become habitual and makes sticking to a budget almost impossible.


## MEASURES TO REDUCE E PAYMENT RISK:

## a. Achieve and maintain PCI Compliance.
The Payment Card Industry’s Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of standards and requirements to help ensure that all online merchants and their customers are protected from fraud and data breaches. Achieving and maintaining your compliance via the PCI Compliance Guide is a critical first step to protecting your eCommerce business. In fact, failing to maintain compliance could result in hefty fines — and could ultimately result in loss of services from reputable eCommerce vendors.


## b. Recognize signs of suspicious activity.
* Unusually large orders or high-priced orders
* Expedited shipping on large quantities or high-priced orders
* Expedited shipping when billing and shipping addresses differ
* Orders where the purchaser asks to pick up the order at your location
* Fake phone numbers (e.g. 555-987-6543)
* Suspect email addresses (e.g. 1234XYZ@gmail.com, or addresses that seem like randomly generated combinations of numbers and letters)
* Inconsistent address information (e.g. zip code doesn’t match state or city)


## c. USE SET

* Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) was a communications protocol standard for securing credit card transactions over insecure networks, specifically, the Internet.
* It was supported initially by Mastercard, Visa, Microsoft, Netscape, and others. 
* With SET, a user is given an electronic wallet (digital certificate) and a transaction is conducted and verified using a combination of digital certificates and digital signatures among the purchaser, a merchant, and the purchaser's bank in a way that ensures privacy and confidentiality. 
* SET makes use of Netscape's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Microsoft's Secure Transaction Technology (STT), and Terisa System's Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP). SET uses some but not all aspects of a public key infrastructure (PKI).


## d. AVS: 
Address Verification System is an automated fraud prevention method used to reduce the risk for merchants selling in the “card-not-present” – e. g. online or telephone purchase – environment. AVS checks the billing address listed in the transaction against any other address registered with the issuing bank. Merchants should request both billing and shipping addresses of the consumer so an AVS check can be conducted before a transaction is processed.

## e. CVV: 
Card Verification Value is the three-digit security code printed on the back of the credit or debit card (in the case of American Express, four digits on the card front). It is not stored in the magnetic strip or embossed on the card, so it can’t be as easily retrieved by thieves unless the card is in their possession. Visa calls it a CVV2, MasterCard calls it a CVC2, and American Express calls it CID. 


## f. Geolocation by IP Address: 
This can help to identify the consumer’s precise location or determine the distance between billing address of the person who is paying for the product and actual location of the person who is placing the online order. Thus, it acts as an additional verification measure or authentication for transactions that have a significant distance discrepancy. Geolocation technology provides information that assistance online business owners conclude which transactions to look deeply into and which to clear. This leads to an even balance between the risks of losses due to fraudulent activity and the risk of preventing legitimate customers from completing their purchases.
